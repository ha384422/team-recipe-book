# team-recipe-book
Our team's favorite recipes  
A well-structured and collaborative website titled Time Machine Recipe Book was developed using HTML and CSS to display various recipes in an organized, interactive, and visually appealing layout. The main page includes a header, a section introducing the team with linked profile photos, and a recipe area showing pictures and titles of each recipe. Each recipe opens on its own page with clear steps, a list of ingredients, and a link to return to the main recipe book. To maintain a consistent and user-friendly design, the structure makes use of internal linking and semantic HTML components.

An external CSS file that adds background pictures, text alignment, hover effects, and flexbox layouts for a tidy and responsive appearance was used to control the visual design. The website is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use thanks to rounded images, shadows, and transitions. The project effectively showcased the coding abilities, and web design concepts. All things considered, the project successfully illustrated the useful application of HTML and CSS principles, producing a simple, appealing, and user-friendly recipe website that showcases technical knowledge and creativity.
